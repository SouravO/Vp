Place the stadium background image here as `hero-stadium.jpg` to enable the Home hero background.

If you have the image file, copy it into this folder (the app references `/hero-stadium.jpg`).

Fallback: if you don't want to add an image, open `src/pages/Home.jsx` and replace the URL in the inline style with an external image URL (e.g., the Unsplash image used previously).
